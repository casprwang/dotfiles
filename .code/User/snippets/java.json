	 // Place your snippets for Java here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	 // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	 // $1, $2 for tab stops, ${id} and ${id:label} and ${1:label} for variables. Variables with the same id are connected.
	 // Example:
	 "Print to console": {
		"prefix": "log",
		"body": [
			"console.log('$1');",
			"$2"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
