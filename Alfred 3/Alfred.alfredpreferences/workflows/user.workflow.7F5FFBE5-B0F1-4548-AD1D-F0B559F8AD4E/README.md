# Search Emoji codes and symbols using Alfred 2

This simple workflow lets you search emoji codes and their symbols.

## Copy the emoji code to use on Campfire, GitHub, etc.
Usage: `emoji [alt key] [query]`

After you hit `enter` the code of the selected emoji will be copied to your
clipboard.

## Copy the actual emoji symbol to use on any OS X app.
Usage: `emoji [query]`

After you hit `enter` the symbol of the selected emoji will be copied to your
clipboard.

## Customizing the keywords:

If you don't like the keywords that are used for triggering the search you can
customize it directly on Alfred. Some suggested using `:` for searching the
emoji code and `emoji` for the actual symbols.

### Last but not least:

* __The `query` argument is optional for both commands. If you don't specify a `query`,
the whole list of emoji will be presented.__

* __You can also search an emoji using related words. Check the full list
[here][related words link]. And also contribute with new words.__
