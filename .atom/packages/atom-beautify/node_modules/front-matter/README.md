This modules does not do any IO (file loading or reading), only extracting yaml front matter from strings.

This concept that was originally introduced to me through the [jeykll][jeykll] blogging system and is pretty useful where you want to be able to easily add metadata to content without the need for a database. YAML is extracted from the the top of a file between matching separators of "---" or "= yaml =".

<!-- This is part of a long running project I have been working on where I am splitting out internals of [haiku][haiku] into to separate, more useful and shareable modules. If your in need of a static site generator [check it out][haiku]. -->

# Install

With [npm][npm] do:

    npm install front-matter

# Example

So you have a file `example.md`:

    ---
    title: Just hack'n
    description: Nothing to see here
    ---

    This is some text about some stuff that happened sometime ago

Then you can do this:

    var fs = require('fs')
      , fm = require('front-matter')

    fs.readFile('./example.md', 'utf8', function(err, data){
      if (err) throw err

      var content = fm(data)

      console.log(content)
    })

And end up with an object like this:

    { attributes: { title: 'Just hack\'n'
      , description: 'Nothing to see here'
      }
    , body: 'This is some text about some stuff that happened sometime ago'
    }

# Methods

    var fm = require('front-matter')

## fm(string)

Return a `content` object with two properties:

* `content.attributes` contains the extracted yaml attributes in json form
* `content.body` contains the string contents below the yaml separators

# fm.test(string)

Check if a string contains a front matter header of "---" or "= yaml =". Primarily used internally but is useful outside of the module.

Returns `true` or `false`

    fm.test(string) #=> true || false
