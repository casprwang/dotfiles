                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <div class="segment">
                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>Years ago when I was working at Travelocity we had three code environments:
                            dev, cert, and production. The dev environment contained the latest code, the
                            cert environment contained the latest code in a minified form, and the
                            production environment contained minified code from the previous release. If a
                            regression error slipped through the unit tests into production it could be hard
                            to immediately identify against the code. Even the most intelligent diff tools
                            proved worthless.</p>
                        <p>Another motivation was linting in the popular
                            <a href="http://jslint.com/">JSLint</a>. When I first needed this application tools like
                            <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a>
                            and
                            <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>
                            did not exist. JSLint was the go to tool for validation. It complained about
                            white space, so I needed something that could beautify code according to the
                            rules of JSLint. As far as I could tell nothing like that existed at the time.
                            The popular
                            <a href="http://jsbeautifier.org/">js-beautify</a>
                            tool could not do this at the time and was painful to extend.</p>
                        <p>I wrote this application as a personal tool. It helped me to become a more
                            productive coder. By having flexible pocket parsers at my disposal I could
                            instantly beautify and compare code against a variety of needs. Never again
                            would I have to worry if a team or tool demanded a certain kind of formatting.
                            Instead of wasting time on unnecessary tasks that software is better suited to
                            perform I can reserve my concentration on my challenging problems. Eventually
                            other people found the tool useful as well and provided suggestions and
                            recommendations that others also needed.</p>

                        <h3>About the tool</h3>
                        <p>Pretty Diff combines language parsers for popular web languages with a
                            comparison tool to create a language aware diff tool. This tool can
                            instantaneously compare minified code to its development counterpart.</p>
                        <p>Since the tool contains language parsers that perform beautify (pretty print)
                            operations a large number of features are available and many more are possible.</p>

                        <p>Writing and maintaining multiple language parsers is hard work. Sometimes
                            help is needed to identify a defect. When defects are identified please

                                beautifier for several languages thanks to
                                <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify/">atom-beautify</a>.</li>

                                &mdash; JSX format can be a real challenge to parse and beautify. It is XML
                                embedded within JavaScript that can then be embedded within HTML. Pretty Diff
                                has this covered with complete support. Read this guide for information on how
                                Pretty Diff accomplished

                                <strong>LESS and SCSS (Sass) CSS support</strong>
                                &mdash; Pretty Diff's
                                <a href="lib/csspretty.js">CSS parser</a>
                                is fully aware that CSS can be extended in support for more powerful languages.
                                This support has earned Pretty Diff inclusion to the
                                <a href="https://github.com/Glavin001/atom-beautify/">atom-beautify</a>

                                &mdash; According to my stats Pretty Diff appears to be several times more
                                popular on the command line. Pretty Diff provides a handy library,
                                api/node-local.js, that is
                                <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>

                                <a href="https://iojs.org/en/index.html">io.js</a>
                                compatible. The command line operation can read/write files and even recursively
                                crawl entire directory trees. This could be helpful when you need to compare
                                dependencies by project version. Read this handy guide for

                                wish you could more easily understand closure and lexical scope? The jsscope
                                feature provides colorful output to identify scope by color and color variables
                                by the scope they are declared. Read these guides about

                                &mdash; There is a fantastic tool called
                                <a href="http://jscs.info/">JSCS</a>
                                that validates code against a variety of style guide rules. Conformance to many
                                of these rules can be easily automated. Pretty Diff added support for style
                                guides which bundle a variety of option settings so that when used with JSCS
                                code authors can focus on more important decisions related to style validation.

                                &mdash; When beautifying markup sometimes there are elements that should not be
                                altered. This is particularly true for any element that receives a CSS rule of
                                <em>white-space: pre</em>. Pretty Diff provides this support via a data attribute. Read the

                                &mdash; White space in XML and HTML is a text node. Pretty Diff is aware that
                                accidentally creating these text nodes can introduce problems when using the DOM
                                or rendering content to the user. Intelligent beautification is a foundational
                                concern of markup parsing in both the beautification and minification processes.</li>

                                &mdash; Missing curly braces, missing semicolons, and other things can make code
                                really hard to read and guess at the author's intentions. Pretty Diff can supply
                                corrections to the code for these issues. For more information read the
                                <a href="guide/jscorrect.xhtml">details</a>
