                <h2>So its kind like recursive command line diff, but in JavaScript</h2>
                <div class="segment">
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Ye ol Unix diff application provides the means to compare changes of all
                        files in a directory tree. diff is awesome at its job, but it certainly isn't
                        Pretty Diff.</p>
                    <p>When used with Node.js
                        <a href="http://prettydiff.com/">Pretty Diff</a>
                        can now output diffs to the command line in color for entire directory trees
                        just like git diff. If you needed to compare an NPM package and all of its
                        dependencies, for example, to a prior version of that package now you can.
                        Changes in each modified file will be listed to the command line as well as
                        files removed and added.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="segment">
                    <h3>A brief example</h3>
                    <p>If I wanted to execute Pretty Diff from the command line with minimal effort
                        I could do the following:</p>
                    <code class="commandLine" data-prettydiff-ignore="true"><span>&gt; npm install prettydiff</span>
    <span>&gt; cd node_modules/prettydiff</span>
    <span>&gt; node api/node-local.js source:"../gulp" diff:"../gulpa"</span>
    </code>
                    <p>The above command downloads the application with NPM tells Node to execute
                        the file api/node-local.js file relatively from the Pretty Diff application. I
                        am going to pass in two arguments which are the source and something to compare
                        it to. In the following example there will be a change to a single line in one
                        file, which could look like the following:</p>
                    <code class="commandLine" data-prettydiff-ignore="true"><span class="meta">node_modules/lib/somefile.js</span>
    <span class="meta">Line 34</span>
    <span>                            } else if (x[cc] === "[") {</span>
    <span>                                block = "]";</span>
    <span class="delete">                                e<strong>e</strong>    += <strong>1</strong>;</span>
    <span class="insert">                                e<strong>f</strong>    += <strong>3</strong>;</span>
    <span>                                dd    += 1;</span>
    <span>                            }</span>
    </code>
                    <p>A line of code with two changes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="segment">
                    <h3>How this executes</h3>
                    <p>The default presentation is to wrap each modification with two lines of
                        unchanged code to provide some context. This can be changed by passing in the
                        <em>context</em>
                        option. If the context option is provided a non-negative integer you get that
                        many lines of context, and if you provide any other value to this option you get
                        the entire file contents.</p>
                    <p>The output is written with just console.log by Node. The entire process is
                        asynchronous, except one point between the moment of reading files and
                        performing the code comparison. The application must sort and compare relative
                        paths to determine if a file is modified and thus needs a formal comparison or
                        is either deleted or inserted.</p>
                    <p>The node file supplied with Pretty Diff can auto-detect file types. This is
                        helpful if Pretty Diff is told to compare two resources but not told what those
                        resources are. If Pretty Diff is provided directories to compare and not told
                        how to read these resources with the
                        <em>readmethod</em>
                        option it will make the assumption that all files in all subdirectories should
                        be analyzed.</p>
                    <p>The command line output is the default behavior if the
                        <em>output</em>
                        option is omitted, which tells Pretty Diff where to save files of the diff
                        results. The command line output can also be forced if the
                        <em>diffcli</em>
                        option is provided with a value of "true".</p>
                    <p>The original intention of Pretty Diff is to be a language aware code analysis
                        tool, but this can be overridden as well. To perform traditional literal text
                        comparisons just pass in the option
                        <em>lang</em>
                        with a value of "text".</p>
                    <p>When I tested the application on a mutilated gulp module I was able to
                        perform several dozen comparisons from over a 1000 evaluated files around 1
                        second in time.</p>
                    <p>Using all these options on the command line may look something like:</p>
                    <code class="commandLine" data-prettydiff-ignore="true">&gt; node api/node-local.js source:"../gulp" diff:"../gulpa" diffcli:"true" context:5 lang:"text" readmethod:"subdirectory"</code>
                </div>
                <p>For additional options check out the
                    <a href="../documentation.xhtml">documentation</a>. I take bug and suggestions for enhancements via email and at
