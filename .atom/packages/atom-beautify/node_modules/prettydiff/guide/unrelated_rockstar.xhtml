                    <h3>In the real world</h3>
                    <p>Becoming a rock star developer is all about competence, capability, and
                        personality. These are factors that often do not perfectly align to online
                        communities. In the real world it always comes down to the ability to solve a
                        given problem, the speed and durability with which that problem is solved, and
                        the ability to work with others and mentor.</p>
                    <p>In the real world a developer has to work with people. These people could be
                        other developers, non-technical peers, corporate leadership, partner companies,
                        clients, or others. These people always notice how quickly a given effort is
                        completed relative to other developers and how well the solution works once
                        completed. These factors go towards a phenomenon called
                        <em>competence</em>. Competence is always under evaluation.</p>
                    <p>In online communities the factors that govern success are generally tethered
                        to qualities of branding, product, and self-marketing. In the real world these
                        factors are nice to have, but are largely insignificant compared to the 3 prior
                        mentioned primary qualities. When self-promotion becomes an individual's most
                        enduring quality the individual will generally be labeled as political,
                        unfocused, or insensitive. Nobody in real world want's to work with people like
                        this, even other people sharing this same quality.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="segment" id="personality">
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Competence alone is not enough. The ability to receive a favorable evaluation
                        from people in the real world is directly biased by the developer's personality.
                        For example, an asshole will never be held up to the same level of capability as
                        a slightly less competent developer who is always pleasant to work with. This is
                        an internal bias that everybody carries and never goes away. In this manner
                        personality is a more important quality than technical competence, because
                        personality is generally easier to observe and faster to evaluate.</p>
                    <p>The biggest challenge regarding personality is the ability to listen to and
                        perceive the non-verbal communication of those around you. In other words if you
                        cannot determine if you are an asshole by reading the people around you then you
                        probably are an asshole. People who struggle in this regard are almost
                        helplessly handicapped from becoming a rock star in the real world.</p>
                    <p>Niceness is not directly related to a rock star personality. A rock star is
                        capable of exercising equal parts charm and authoritarian decisiveness depending
                        upon the given situation. The goal is often not to make friends, and certainly
                        not to make enemies, but to accomplish the current given task efficiently and
                        build enduring relationships in the process.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="segment" id="honest">
                    <h3>Honesty</h3>
                    <p>A rock star strives for honesty always. Honesty is a challenge that many
                        people frequently fail at. Total honesty requires a dedicated alertness into an
                        individual's own three forms of communication: verbal, non-verbal, and desire.
                        Verbal honesty relates to the truthfulness of what a person says. Non-verbal
                        honesty relates to a person's body language when speaking and the physical
                        responses when listening or receiving communication both verbal and non-verbal.
                        Honesty of desire describes a person's goals, intentions, and motivations.</p>
                    <p>Honesty in desire is something many people struggle with. This struggle is
                        frequently referred by terms like
                        <em>cognitive complexity</em>
                        and possibly
                        <em>cognitive conservatism</em>. This is challenging because many people are not
                        honest with themselves. For instance a person may claim to make a decision for
                        the health of the product when instead they could be trying to impress a boss or
                        complete an unrelated objective. This internalized self-dishonesty results in a
                        pattern of behaviors that leave observers confused and filled with doubt or
                        remorse.</p>
                    <p>It is challenging to detect honesty, and it is much easier to detect
                        dishonesty. This likely explains why external observers are frequently more apt
                        at detecting an individual's internal confusion than the individual. Dishonesty
                        is the greatest enemy of trust and rock star is somebody who has no trouble
                        inspiring trust. To avoid dishonesty means harmonizing verbal communications,
                        non-verbal communications, and desires.</p>
                    <p>Once a total communication harmony is achieved positive behaviors replace
                        distracting behaviors, particularly: humbleness, dedication, and focus. It also
                        means a person is quick to accept and volunteer blame for failure and a
                        willingness to ask for mentorship. Rock stars are quick to admit when they have
                        shortcomings and welcome assistance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="segment" id="confidence">
                    <h3>Confidence</h3>
                    <p>An unintended benefit to total honesty is
                        <em>confidence</em>. Even in the event that probability of failure is extremely
                        high a rock star is willing to openly discuss the perception of failure
                        particularly when not politically expedient. In other words a rock star remains
                        maintains confidence long after doubts are exposed.</p>
                    <p>A common and extremely destructive quality that frequently emerges in the
                        absence of confidence is
                        <em>defensiveness</em>. Like with other desires an individual may not realize
                        when they are being defensive, but everybody around them will see it with
                        crystal clear clarity. Emotional defensiveness is an unproductive selfish
                        quality that distracts from a team effort.</p>
                    <p>High confidence is required to challenge deeply held beliefs whether those
                        beliefs come from superiors, peers, or the rock star themself. This challenge is
                        called
                        <em>critical evaluation</em>. The ability to examine a new approach and
                        determine whether this new approach should replace conventions universally
                        taught by a highly respected university are often necessary and can cause
                        friction. The ability to perform this evaluation requires technical competence,
                        confidence, and a devotion to product and the current technology. It also
                        requires an ability to challenge popular concepts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="segment" id="popularity">
                    <h3>Disregard for popularity</h3>
                    <p>Imagine, if you will, a bell curve diagram. If you need help there are plenty
                        examples online of the bell curve. In a measure of trends and competence the
                        substantial bulk of a given demographic will (almost universally) reside close
                        to the average of those surveyed. The exceedingly incompetent, as statistically
                        measured against the entire body of sample data, will be on one extreme end of
                        the bell curve and the rock star on the opposite end of the bell curve.</p>
                    <p>The important consideration in examining data against a bell curve is that
                        both the incompetent people and the rock stars tend to be extreme minorities
                        once a large enough sample of persons is evaluated. This means there is
                        something different or irregular about rock stars that the general body of
                        developers don't have. This single special factor can be summarized as a
                        willingness to do things that are not popular. If, as a developer, you only work
                        towards popular concepts you are statically incapable of ever becoming a rock
                        star.</p>
                    <p>This makes sense if considered from the perspective of technical challenges.
                        Challenging things will always be less popular, because challenge suggests
                        opportunity for failure, which in turn causes fear. A rock star developer will
                        tend to be both risk adverse and simultaneously really good at risk analysis.
                        That combination of factors eliminates the fear that comes with challenges and
                        allows the rock star the willingness and capability average developers do not
                        possess.</p>
                    <p>My favorite example of this concept is
                        <em>jQuery</em>. A few years ago the jQuery framework achieved religious status.
                        Many developers required this tool and could not do their jobs without it. The
                        religious concept was so deeply embedded that many developers would never
                        consider questioning the use of jQuery, as in such a though process would never
                        arise. I had several developers refuse to attend job interviews once they became
                        aware there would be a technical evaluation and they could not use jQuery. A
                        rock star developer would either or already have the skills to operate without
                        this tool or would be willing to rise to the challenge.</p>

                <div class="segment" id="criticality">
                    <h3>Criticality in all things</h3>
                    <p>Perhaps the most obvious trait that comprises a rock star is the ability to
                        solve problems that few other people are capable of solving, but doing so
                        quickly with a simple and elegant approach. How to arrive to that potential is
                        certainly less than obvious. A significant factor is the ability to quickly form
                        independent and original conclusions. That means answering the
                        <em>why</em>
                        questions with confidence and with profound individuality. This is referred to
                        as
                        <em>critical decision making</em>. Being critical absolutely reinforces decision
                        making that has no regard for popularity.</p>
                    <p>For an extreme minority of any given social population this sort of critical
                        reasoning comes naturally. The
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>
                        personality describes these sort of natural engineers as INTP and INTJ
                        personality types who combined comprise 5-9% of any larger group. Other
                        personality segments must tirelessly work to achieve a critical focus and often
                        in defiance of their most inclusive social reference group.</p>
                    <p>A continuous critical focus allows a person a greater ability to perceive any
                        problem according to its technical merits without distraction from popular
                        conclusions. For many people this is extremely challenging because most
                        personality types strive to achieve peace and tranquility through arriving at a
                        perceived social mean. A critical focus allows a person to separate the social
                        merits of a proposed solution from technical merits, which is frequently seen as
                        challenging and disruptive. As a developer an extreme critical nature is often
                        met with frustration from less critical personalities operating in a technical
                        capacity and often applauded by non-technical decision makers. This is perhaps
                        the most striking difference between a real world rockstar and an online rock
                        star.</p>
                    <p>The ability to separate the technical merits from the social merits of a
                        proposed solution and challenge opinions directly is not always welcome in many
                        online communities. In the professional world this is often an extremely well
                        valued trait frequently referred to as
                        <em>positive confrontations</em>. The ability to focus on the given problem
                        directly and put politics aside is absolutely required to achieve rock star
                        status.</p>
                    <p>In regard for political versus technical merit it is generally easy to weed
                        out weaker engineers from the actual and potential rock stars. When a technical
                        conversation ever shifts focus to a developer in the conversation instead of the
                        technology the conversation has immediately failed, and can safely be referred
                        to an
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">ad hominem</a>. Often when a
                        technical conversation becomes stuck in political muck it is often because one
                        or more developers in the conversation lacks confidence to continue approaching
                        the conversation independently. From a critical perspective a technical opinion,
                        even if wrong, is more valuable than competing opinions if it continues to stand
                        its ground with original argumentation and is never distracted by less technical
                        considerations.</p>
                    <p>Critical personalities strongly avoid absolute language. Absolute language
                        suggests that a provided opinion is formally complete without need for challenge
                        and frequently makes use of words like:
                        <em>always</em>,
                        <em>never</em>,
                        <em>will</em>,
                        <em>must</em>,
                        <em>right</em>, and
                        <em>wrong</em>. Critical thinking requires that every decision point is open to
                        challenge and independent consideration. I recently had a conversation that
                        suggested looping through arrays is always inferior to using a
                        <em>foreach</em>
                        method. A rock star developer would consider each option uniquely against a
                        currently problem and make an independent decision. Rock stars generally
                        perceive absolute opinions as less mature or an inferior reasoning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="segment" id="expectations">
                    <h3>Set higher expectations</h3>
                    <p>Rock stars set unpopular high expectations that may impede progress in the
                        short-term but dramatically increase developer productivity in the long term.
                        Strong standards will unintentionally lower maintenance churn. A rock star will
                        limit the high standards they wish to impose. A real rock star does not set
                        standards merely for the point of writing standards or fulfilling a personality
                        disorder, such as
                        <em>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</em>.</p>
                    <p>The primary difference between the high standards set by a rock star versus
                        those set by somebody with OCD is that a rock star can speak to qualities of
                        risk analysis, performance, profiling, searchability, and understandability
                        using research and quantitative data. The high standards set by an OCD type are
                        generally motivated by stylistic concerns (code vanity), irrational ordering
                        conventions, and other emotionally motivated factors that are hard to quantify.</p>
                    <p>I like to use the tool
                        <em>JSHint</em>
                        as an example. It is far more popular than the older JSLint and it is also less
                        terse and more flexible. JSLint is a far stricter tool, which makes it far less
                        popular, but any code that passes JSLint will always pass JSHint. The common
                        argument for favoring JSHint against JSLint is something along the lines of
                        "It's too opinionated.", which is completely misleading because JSLint is
                        extremely opinionated about its options and settings and so is JSHint. For many
                        years JSLint's motto was, "it will hurt your feelings."</p>

                <div class="segment" id="directness">
                    <h3>Technical directness</h3>
                    <p>Rock star developers are able to approach problems directly and reason about
                        related technologies with a rare and excessive depth. For instance, HTML is
                        often regarded as s simplistic technology demanding of trivial care. A rock star
                        client-side web developer would separate themselves from average developers by
                        learning more about HTML by studying how markup languages are formed and solving
                        for various language design problems and identifying constraints. A greater
                        depth of expertise allows a superior understanding of advanced concerns like
                        accessibility and semantics that average developers would likely miss
                        completely. It provides a deep understanding of why the Document Object Model
                        (DOM) was designed the way it is how it actually works. I remember a recent
                        conversation I had with somebody representing a major standards body who
                        represented the DOM standards specification and did not have this history. Their
                        understanding of the technology they represented was shallow and less complete
                        causing major missteps in their reasoning about this technology.</p>
                    <p>Learning JavaScript directly means the ability to write in that language
                        without assistance from additional technologies and understanding why certain
                        code design decisions work better than alternative decisions. It also means
                        learning about how the language works and what makes it different from other
                        languages. It requires studying the language's history and learning why the
                        language was designed as it is and the ability to independently consider the
                        pros and cons of those decisions.</p>
                    <p>A rock star JavaScript developer is completely comfortable writing JavaScript
                        without frameworks and reasoning about the DOM directly. They fully understand
                        the language's scope model and separately understand the model of inheritance
                        and why certain features of other languages compete with this scope model. They
                        understand the actual value and weaknesses of popular JavaScript frameworks
                        before ever recommending their use.</p>
