## Detailed summary

### Guide / tutorial

Write a guide either similar to Om / React / Mithril or write
  a tutorial walking through authoring one of the exmaples

### Documentation

We should write high quality docs for mercury AND all it's direct
  dependencies.

### Motivation & Philosophy

This is hand wavey

### Benchmarks

Mostly done, just need to mention them

### Websites / logo

Would be nice to have a proper gh-pages or proper mercuryjs.com

### VDOM thunks

Implement thunks in virtual-dom & update vdom-thunk to use thunks
  instead of widgets

### 2048 & github issues

Implement these examples, 2048 is already a branch

### lazy observables

Implement lazy data structures for performance

### test debt

Deal with the fact that both mercury & some of its dependencies
  dont have any tests
