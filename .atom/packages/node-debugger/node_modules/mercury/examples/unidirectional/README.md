# Building your own unidirectional framework

`mercury` contains a set of modules that you can use to build
  you own framework.

This folder contains a set of examples that demonstrate using
  a subset of mercury with other existing modules to build your
  own opinion about doing unidirectional apps.

**Disclaimer:** These examples are for demonstration purpose
  only, I am neutral as to whether these examples are a "good" or
  "bad" idea, use at your own risk.
