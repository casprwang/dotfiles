## [0.11.4]
- Added inline documentation with an overlay decoration. Use <kbd>alt-o</kbd> and get the documentation (if any) for the thing under the cursor.
- Some improvements how files get registered and updated. This should produce less errors and a better compatibility for projects not using the `loadEagerly` property and projects without a `.tern-project` file.
