# jsxformat

Used for atom-react (atom react support).

Tool to reformat JSX (react) code. Splits tags with multiple attributes into multiple lines. Adds line breaks to multiple nested tags on the same line.


NOTE: This tool doesn't currently reindent formatted code. Indentation is handled on the atom-react plugin side.
