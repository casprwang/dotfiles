          # Working with Altera Quartus II (Q2) and do proper versioning is not that easy
          # but if you follow some rules it can be accomplished. :)
          # This file should be placed into the main directory where the .qpf file is
          # found. Generally Q2 throws all entities and so on in the main directory, but
          # you can place all stuff also in separate folders. This approach is followed
          # here. So when you create a new design create one or more folders where your
          # entities will be located and put a .gitignore in there that overrides the
          # ignores of this file, e.g. one single rule stating "!*" which allows now all
          # type of files. When you add a MegaFunction or another entity to your design,
          # simply add it to one of your private folders and Q2 will be happy and manage
          # everything quite good. When you want to do versioning of your generated
          # SOF/POF files, you can do this by redirecting the generated output to an own
          # folder. To do this go to:
          # "Assignments"
          #   -> "Settings
          #      -> "Compilation Process Settings"
          #         -> "Save project output files in specified directory"
          # Now you can either place a .gitignore in the directory and allow the following
          # list of types:
          #   !*.sof
          #   !*.pof
          # or you create an own submodule in the folder to keep binary files out of your
          # design.
